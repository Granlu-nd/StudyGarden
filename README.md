# 🌱 Study Garden 🌱

**Study Garden** is a gamified study-tracking web app where productive time earns you rewards to grow a virtual garden.  
Every minute of focused study gives you resources (coins) to unlock plants, seeds, and decorations.  
It’s both a **study tool** and a **casual game** to keep you motivated.
